Recent works have investigated the role of graph bottlenecks in preventing long-range information propagation in message-passing graph neural networks, causing the so-called 'over-squashing' phenomenon. As a remedy, graph rewiring mechanisms have been proposed as preprocessing steps. Graph Echo State Networks (GESNs) are a reservoir computing model for graphs, where node embeddings are recursively computed by an untrained message-passing function. In this paper, we show that GESNs can achieve a significantly better accuracy on six heterophilic node classification tasks without altering the graph connectivity, thus suggesting a different route for addressing the over-squashing problem.
